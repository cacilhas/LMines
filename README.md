# Game of Life

[Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a
zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game
of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
evolves or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular
properties.
